# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains ADRs — permanent records of accepted architectural decisions.

ADRs are created after an RFC is accepted.
They are immutable; to change a decision, create a new ADR that supersedes the previous one.

## Format

```
adr-NN-short-title.md
```

## Index

No ADRs yet.
The first will be created when RFC-001 is accepted.
